Start by going through all the houses and building a well if that is the cheapest option, and add them to a supplied list. For all pipes between a supplied house and an unsupplied house, build the cheapest pipe and make the unsupplied house supplied. Repeat until all houses have been supplied with water. If there are no more supplied pipe connections and some houses still do not have water, build the cheapest well and continue.
