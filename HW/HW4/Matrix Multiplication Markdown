Let n be the number of rows in A, m be the number of columns in A, and p be the number of columns in B.
I don't know if throwing errors counts for time complexity, but if so, the best case for matrix multiplication would be Θ(1), when the number of columns in A and number of rows in B are not equal.
Otherwise, for best, average, and worst case, matix multiplication uses nested loops where the outer loop runs n times, the middle loop runs m times within the outer loop, and the inner loop runs p times within the middle loop. So, the tome complexity of matix multiplication is Θ(n * m * p).
