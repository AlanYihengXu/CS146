Brute force solution: for each element, find if there are two more elements that with it add up to zero, then check if this solution was already in the output.
Or, sort the array, for every element and for every second element, use a binary search to find a third element to add up to zero. If the two elements added together with the last element is < 0, it doesn't exist. When incrementing elements, skip if the same as the last element. If both elements are > 0, end because no more exist.
