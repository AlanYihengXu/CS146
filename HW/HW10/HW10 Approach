We want to go through each layer of the tree and add each node of a layer to some list. Then, we add that list to an output list and loop through first list to add every child of the nodes in that list to a new list.
We can do this by making a List and adding the root to it, then adding that List to a higher List. We then loop through that higher List, and for every List within that List we loop through the nodes and add the children of those nodes to a new List. Afterwards, we add the List created by that to the higher List. This repeats until there are no more children.
However, since the output needs to be a List<List\<Integer>> rather than a List<List\<TreeNode>>, we instead need an extra data structure to manage the TreeNodes and spit their values into a List afterward. Thus, we use a queue to go through the tree. To maintain the levels, the length of the queue before each outer loop is how many nodes are on that level.
