Kahn's Algorithm is basically a BFS already, just with it keeping track of the indegrees of each vertex. Because that is required for topological sort, the BFS approach is identical to Kahn's Algorithm.
For the DFS approach, it goes through all the vertexes in the graph and runs DFS on them, and if a vertex doesn't have an outgoing edge or all the vertices it points at have been added to the output stack, it gets added to the output stack.
Sample input: the example graph from the topological sort slides, whose edge list is:
1: 3
2: 4
3: 5, 6, 7
4: 5, 6, 7
5: 8
6: 8
7: 8
8:
